**Abstract:**   
Advances in the field of bioinformatics have led to reconstruction of genome-
scale networks for a number of key organisms. The application of
physicochemical constraints to these stoichiometric networks allows
researchers, through methods such as flux balance analysis, to highlight key
sets of reactions necessary to achieve particular objectives. The key benefits
of constraint-based analysis lie in the minimal knowledge required to infer
systemic properties. However, network degeneracy leads to a large number of
flux distributions that satisfy any objective; moreover, these distributions
may be dominated by biologically irrelevant internal cycles. By examining the
geometry underlying the problem, we define two methods for finding a unique
solution within the space of all possible flux distributions; such a solution
contains no internal cycles, and is representative of the space as a whole.
The first method draws on typical geometric knowledge, but cannot be applied
to large networks because of the high computational complexity of the problem.
Thus a second method, an iteration of linear programs which scales easily to
the genome scale, is defined. The algorithm is run on four recent genome-scale
models, and unique flux solutions are found. The algorithm set out here will
allow researchers in flux balance analysis to exchange typical solutions to
their models in a reproducible format. Moreover, having found a single
solution, statistical analyses such as correlations may be performed.
